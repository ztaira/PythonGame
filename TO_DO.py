This game is limited by the framerate. In an effort to make something cooler,
I'm going to move everything over to C++. As the true purpose of this
project was to get used to graphics in tkinter, I am satisfied with the result.

Types of object:
    Player-related hitboxes: player bullets, player sprite
    Damaging hitboxes
    Non-damaging Hitboxes
    reflecting hitboxes
